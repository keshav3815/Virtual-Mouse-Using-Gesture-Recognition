1.	Problem statement:

Design an AI-enabled application for emotion/gesture detection


2.	Key Features/Benefits:

(i)	The proposed model has a greater accuracy of 99% which is far greater than the that of other proposed models for virtual mouse, and it has many applications.

(ii)	Amidst the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to control the PC mouse functions without using the physical mouse

(iii)	The system can be used to control robots and automation systems without the usage of devices

(iv)	2D and 3D images can be drawn using the AI virtual system using the hand gestures

(v)	AI virtual mouse can be used to play virtual reality- and augmented reality-based games without the wireless or wired mouse devices

(vi)	Persons with problems in their hands can use this system to control the mouse functions in the computer

(vii)	In the field of robotics, the proposed system like HCI can be used for controlling robots

(viii)	In designing and architecture, the proposed system can be used for designing virtually for prototypin


3.	Software used:

•	Pycharm

PyCharm is a dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) providing a wide range of essential tools for Python developers, tightly integrated to create a convenient environment for productive Python, web, and data science development.

4.	Deliverables:
•	The main objective of the proposed AI virtual mouse system is to develop an alternative to the regular and traditional mouse system to perform and control the mouse functions.
•	This can be achieved with the help of a web camera that captures the hand gestures and hand tip and then processes these frames to perform the particular mouse function such as left click, right click, dragging and scrolling function.
•	The AI virtual mouse system is useful for many applications; it can be used to reduce the space for using the physical mouse, and it can be used in situations where we cannot use the physical mouse.

6.	Summary:

From the results of the model, we can come to a conclusion that the proposed AI virtual mouse system has performed very well and has a greater accuracy compared to the existing models and also the model overcomes most of the limitations of the existing systems. Since the proposed model has greater accuracy, the AI virtual mouse can be used for real-world applications, and also, it can be used to reduce the spread of COVID-19, since the proposed mouse system can be used virtually using hand gestures without using the traditional physical mouse.


7.	Additional Creative Inputs (If Any): Learning outcomes (What I have learnt):
•	The most important outcome of this project is to learn things in collaborative way . 
•	The other outcome of this project is to create push in evolution of the mouse which have been stagnant throughout the years.
•	To able to control the mouse input visually .
•	2D and 3D images can be drawn using the AI virtual system using the hand gestures
•	In the field of robotics, the proposed system like HCI can be used for controlling robots
•	AI virtual mouse can be used to play virtual reality- and augmented reality-based games without the wireless or wired mouse devices
